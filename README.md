## Memory Management System
### Project Specifications :

1- Kernel heap: allow the kernel to dynamically allocate and free memory space at run-time (for user directory, page tables â€¦etc.)

2- Load and run multiple user programs that are partially loaded in main memory and fully loaded in secondary memory (H.D.D.)

3- Handle page faults during execution by applying Modified Clock Algorithm .

4- User heap: Allow user program to dynamically allocate and free memory space at run-time (i.e. malloc and free functions) by applying NEXT FIT strategy.

5- Shared variables: Allow user programs to dynamically create and share variables at run-time by applying NEXT FIT strategy
